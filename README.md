Angular2HeroesTutorial
========

Just following along with angular.io's tutorial. Figured I'd mess around with git while I was at it.

# How to run

Super simple: just start npm in the root directory

```sh
npm install
```

If you get an error, it's probably because you don't have typings

```sh
npm run typings install
npm start
```
